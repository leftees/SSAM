Changes between V1.0 and 1.4:
-----------------------------

Version1.4
      *Form layout changed to accommodate a wider display of SSA log file.

      *SSA log display was a simple copy of the SSA log file contents loaded 
       into a textarea. It is now displayed in a more user-friendly manner.

      *The example form is no longer required. Instead, the real form will auto-fill
       with example fields on when first run.

      *Added the ability to view the Cron log file. This consists of a read only 
       textarea. Further formatting is impractical due to the unknown content added by 
       the Cron process. Path to Cron file must be entered in the appropriate field.

      *All responses now appear to the right of the form.
      
      *Fixed bug where the info icons stayed on top when the info pop-up appeared.            

Version1.3
      *File 'simplesiteaudit_settings.php' - name changed to 'index.php'. Access 
       with URL: http://domain.com/ssa/ or http://domain.com/ssa/index.php
      
      *As direct access to 'includes/clear_log.php' would instantly clear the log
       file, without warning, the file can now only be accessed via 'index.php'. 
       Page now redirects to index.php.

      *The 'Empty the log' button was a 1-click operation, which left the log file
       open to accidental emptying. Now the button needs to be requested via the 
       red question mark button.

      *The 'Create log' checkbox is now working correctly.

Version1.2:
      *Changed the file names to all lower case. If upper case  characters are
       included, it can cause problems, like 404 errors,where it's being read in
       a case-sensitive manner. The file names themselves, must not be changed, as 
       they are referenced from one to the other.
  
      *Where the user does not have access to offline directories. Advice has been 
       added to the readme file and the top info icon. 
  
      *Added a button to empty the log file (a 1-click operation which might need
       safeguarding at some point).
       
      *Added a button to display the file contents. These only appear after the
       log file is created, i.e. when the ssa script is first run.


Version1.1:
      *The option to show/hide the example form, which actually consists of some
       read only text boxes and are copyable. It will now appear side by side with
       the real form.
      
      *The field, 'Directory being monitored' is now a drop-down menu that lists
       all directories in directoryToMonitor. So it's even easier to find the
       directory of your choice. On large sites this element can take several seconds
       to fully load.
      
      *I've added an option to create a log file and a further option to clear it.
      
      *Confirmation responses appear under the buttons.
             

Version1.0
      *First release
